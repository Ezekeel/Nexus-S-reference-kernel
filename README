This is the reference kernel for my kernel modifications
which I currently use on my Nexus S i9020 (with CM 7.03).

It is based on Netarchy's netarchy-nexus-1.3.4-bfs-2.3.3
kernel updated to BLN version 9.

The currently implemented modifications are:
- Backlight Dimmer (BLD) version 3
- Screen Dimmer version 1 
- Touch Wake version 1
