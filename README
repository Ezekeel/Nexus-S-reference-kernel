This is the reference kernel for my kernel modifications which I currently 
use on my Nexus S i9020 (with CM 7.03).

It is based on Netarchy's netarchy-nexus-1.3.4-bfs-2.3.3 kernel updated to 
BLN version 9.

The currently implemented modifications are:
- Backlight Dimmer (BLD) version 3
- Screen Dimmer version 1 
- Touch Wake version 1
- Battery Life eXtender (BLX) version 1
- Kernel option 'CONFIG_MTD_SHOWHIDDEN': Unpartitioned memory space between 
  two partitions is additionally added as an extra partition.
- 'Lazy' CPUfreq governor
- Live OC version 1

I do not accept donations and since I reached my 50GB limit of free space 
on SpiderOak, thanks to all of you kind people who got an account using my 
referral link, I could not ask for more. 
Instead if you really want to donate your hard earned money to someone who 
deserves and needs it, consider donating to the Free Software Foundation at 
fsf.org: These guys are at the frontline when it comes to keeping Linux free 
and fighting these greedy bastards who think they are entitled to collect 
royalties and other fees from Linux users due to some silly patents - and if 
Linux falls, Android will be next.
